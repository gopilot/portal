# Pilot Student & Organizer Portal

This is the portal used by students and organizers of our events.

## Development
- `gulp`: Compiles all resources into the `out/` directory
- `gulp watch`: Compiles all resources, watches them for changes, and runs a webserver in the `out/` directory
- `gulp deploy`: Compiles all resources and pushes the `out/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch
